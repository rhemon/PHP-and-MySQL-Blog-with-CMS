PHP-and-MySQL-Blog-with-CMS
===========================

This is a blog with CMS. Basically, beside the blog, the creator (admin) of the blog can sign in to the admin interface where you can add, delete and change posts. Beside managing the content, this project also provides management for admins, the root admin can only add and delete admins, the rest can only edit their own info. This project was made for practice.
